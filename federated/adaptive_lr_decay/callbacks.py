class ReduceLROnPlateau(object):
  """A callback for decaying a learning rate when a metric stops improving.

  Attributes:
    learning_rate: The current learning rate.
    monitor: The name of the metric governing the callback.
    decay_factor: Factor by which the learning rate will be reduced when a
      plateau occurs.
    minimize: A boolean, when `True` the metric will be minimized, otherwise
      maximized.
    best: The previous best metric result. The initial value of this should be
      set so that any reasonable metric improves upon the best. For example, if
      `minimize = True`, then `best = np.Inf` serves as a reasonable initial
      value.
    min_delta: The amount by which the monitored metric must improve upon the
      best previous metric in order for there to be definite improvement. For
      example, if we set `minimize=True`, then a new value of the metric is said
      to be better than the previous best value only if `metric <= best -
      min_delta`.
    min_lr: The minimum learning rate, beyond which no decay is allowed.
    window_size: The number of rounds to average the metric across. In federated
      learning, we typically do not have access to metrics computed over the
      entire training set at any given round. Instead, we compute the average of
      the monitored metric over the last `window_size` rounds, and use this as
      an estimate of the true value of the monitored metric over the entire
      training set.
    metrics_window: A list of the value of the metric over the last
      `window_size` rounds. This should be initialized according to the
      `minimize` argument, similar to how `best` is initialized. For example, if
      `minimize = True`, then initializing `metrics_window` to be a list of
      `np.Inf` values of length `window_size` is a reasonable initialization.
    patience: The number of rounds that must occur with no improvement before
      the learning rate can be reduced. This parameter is used to ensure that
      learning rate decay does not occur too frequently. This parameter is
      independent but related to the `window_size` argument. In general, one
      should set `patience` to be at least on the order of `window_size` in
      order to ensure that the plateau is not an artifact of the client
      selection over some small number of rounds. A good starting heuristic is
      `patience = window_size`.
    wait: The number of rounds that have passed with no improvement.
    cooldown: The number of rounds that must occur before reducing the learning
      rate. This should
      generally be at least as large as `window_size`, so that enough rounds
      pass to allow metrics_window to be an accurate estimate of the current
      metric.
    cooldown_counter: The number of rounds remaining in the cooldown period.
      Resets after the learning rate has been decayed. While in the cooldown
      period, the `wait` parameter is set to 0. Thus, the total number of rounds
      before the learning rate decays is at least `cooldown + patience`.
