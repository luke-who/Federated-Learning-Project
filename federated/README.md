# Federated Research

Federated Research is a collection of research projects related to
[Federated Learning](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html)
and
[Federated Analytics](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/05/federated-analytics-collaborative-data.html).
Federated learning is an approach to machine learning where a shared global
model is trained across many participating clients that keep their training data
locally. Federated analytics is the practice of applying data science methods to
the analysis of raw data that is stored locally on usersâ€™ devices.

Many of the projects contained in this repository use
[TensorFlow Federated (TFF)](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated), an
open-source framework for machine learning and other computations on
decentralized data. For an overview and introduction to TFF, please see the
[list of tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/tutorials/federated_learning_for_image_classification).
For information on using TFF for research, see
[TFF for research](https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/tff_for_research).

## Recommended Usage

The main purpose of this repository is for reproducing experimental results in
related papers. None of the projects (or subfolders) here is intended to be a
resusable framework or package.

*   The recommended usage for this repository is to `git clone` and follow the
    instruction in each indedpendent project to run the code, usually with
    `bazel`.

There is a special module `utils/` that is widely used as a dependency for
projects in this repository. Some of the functions in `utils/` are in the
process of upstreaming to the
[TFF package](https://github.com/google-research/federated). However, `utils/`
is not promised to be a stable API and the code may change in any time.

*   The recommended usage for `utils/` is to fork the necessary piece of code
    for your own research projects.
*   If you find `utils/` and maybe other projects helpful as a module that your
    projects want to depend on (and you accept the risk of depending on
    potentially unstable and unsupported code), you can use `git submodule` and
    add the module to your python path. See
    [this example](https://github.com/michaelreneer/experiment).
